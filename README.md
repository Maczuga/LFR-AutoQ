# Auto LFR queuing addon for 5.4 (or even past expansions)

## Commands
`/alfr all` - queues you to all unfinished (or partially done) wings with all avaiable to your class specs

You can also use/combine spec types:

`/alfr dps heal`

`/alfr tank`

`/alfr dps tank heal` (= `/alfr all`)


You can also use sections:
- msv
- hof
- toes
- tot
- soo

Sections can be combined like roles. To queue for MSV, HoF, ToT and SoO (for example you don't wanna queue for ToES, because you wanna complete The Fear Itself quest soon) as all available roles:

`alfr all msv hof tot soo` (order is whatever you want)
